Project Overview: Password Entropy System

Project Developer: Isaac Oyekunle | isaac@etcvibes.com | oyekunleisaac8@gmail.com

Project Description:

The Password Entropy System project aims to develop a web-based application that assesses password strength using advanced security measures based on OWASP guidelines and Regex checks. The system evaluates passwords against stringent criteria including character diversity (digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters), length, and adherence to common password patterns. 

Key Features:

1. Regex Checks: Implemented to validate password complexity requirements such as character types and special characters.
   
2. OWASP Framework Integration: Incorporates security guidelines from OWASP to ensure robust protection against common password vulnerabilities.
   
3. Behavioral Analysis: Provides behavioral analysis capabilities to detect and mitigate potential risks associated with predictable password usage patterns.
   
4. Content-aware Analysis: Utilizes content-aware analysis techniques to identify and reject passwords based on commonly used or easily guessed patterns.

Functionality:

Upon submission of a password, the system provides real-time feedback including:

- Score: Quantitative measure of password strength based on established criteria.
  
- Entropy: Measure of password unpredictability, reflecting the randomness and complexity of the password.
  
- Feedback: Detailed insights into password strengths and weaknesses, highlighting areas for improvement.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to enhance security measures by providing users with accurate assessments of password strength and promoting the adoption of strong, secure passwords across our platform. By leveraging advanced security techniques and user-friendly feedback mechanisms, we aim to mitigate risks associated with password-based vulnerabilities and ensure robust protection of user credentials.

Conclusion:

The Password Entropy System represents a significant step forward in strengthening our platform's security posture. Moving forward, we will continue to refine and optimize the system based on user feedback and emerging security standards, reinforcing our commitment to safeguarding user data.
